# using-excel-data-in-python-for-cluster-analysis

I keep getting this error "TypeError: '_io.TextIOWrapper' object is not callable". I am new to programming and just completed coursera.
Trying to work with my own excel file for cluster analysis in python. 

Any help to correct me is really appreciated. 

Thank you 

Cheers
Vrinda
